Pragmasoft is a technological company. On a daily basis we build software and AI products. We use proven agile methodologies (no SCRUM-but) and adhere to their best practices. Since sharing is caring, we want to give away to you some examples of our work. Sometimes it will be best-of-breed industry practices in action, sometimes just peculiarities we encountered, and yet sometimes even post-mortems.

Stay tuned, enjoy!
